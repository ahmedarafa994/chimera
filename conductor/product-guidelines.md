# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- **Cyber-Adversarial & Edgy:** The platform adopts a direct, high-stakes communication style that mirrors the adversarial nature of security research. It avoids corporate fluff in favor of a clandestine, authoritative tone.

## Visual Aesthetic
- **Clean High-Tech:** The UI features a modern, professional "Red Team" aesthetic. This means a focus on crisp layouts, minimalist color palettes (primarily whites, greys, and blacks), and sophisticated typography. The design should feel like a premium, specialized research instrument.

## User Experience (UX) Prioritization
- **Efficiency & Speed:** The interface is designed for power users. This includes keyboard-centric workflows, minimal friction for common tasks (like launching a campaign), and optimized data density.
- **Visual Clarity:** Information is presented with high legibility. Complex telemetry is distilled into clear charts and visualizations to ensure that critical insights are discoverable at a glance.

## Writing and Prose Standards
- **Technical Precision:** Use exact security and AI terminology. Accuracy is prioritized over simplification; terms like "adversarial payload," "refusal boundary," and "vector embedding" are used correctly and consistently to maintain credibility with a researcher audience.

## Brand Identity Integration
- **Thematic & Functional Hybrid:** Chimera blends its mythological naming ("Aegis," "Chimera") with a high-tech professional toolset. Branding elements (like icons or specific module names) lean into the narrative metaphors, while the core navigation remains grounded in functional technical utility.
