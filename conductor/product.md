# Initial Concept
Chimera is an Adversarial Prompting & Red Teaming Platform for AI security research, providing tools for LLM robustness testing through advanced prompt transformation, jailbreak research, and multi-agent adversarial testing.

# Product Vision
Chimera aims to be the premier platform for AI security researchers and red teamers to discover, document, and analyze LLM vulnerabilities. By combining algorithmic optimization with sophisticated narrative techniques, it empowers users to rigorously test and improve the safety of large language models.

# Target Audience
- **AI Security Researchers:** Focused on discovering and documenting new LLM vulnerabilities and jailbreak techniques.
- **Red Teamers:** Performing authorized adversarial simulations against enterprise AI deployments.

# Core Technical Capabilities
- **Automated Jailbreak Optimization:** Iterative refinement of prompts using algorithms like AutoDAN to identify bypasses for safety filters.
- **Narrative-Driven Attacks:** A sophisticated "Chimera" engine that wraps malicious payloads in complex, multi-layer fictional and narrative contexts (e.g., Sandbox, Fiction, Debugging) to decouple requests from reality.

# Primary Usage Mode
- **Interactive Web Dashboard:** A centralized, visual interface for configuring attack campaigns, monitoring real-time progression, and performing in-depth analysis of results.

# Key User Goals
- **Vulnerability Discovery:** Identifying specific, reproducible prompt sequences that trigger unsafe content generation or sensitive data leakage.

# Output & Reporting
- **Comprehensive PDF/Markdown Reports:** Detailed technical findings, attack logs, and quantifiable success metrics for stakeholders and documentation.
- **Live Interactive Visualizations:** Real-time graphs, heatmaps, and refusal analysis displayed within the dashboard for immediate insight.
