  **Context:** You are a senior software engineer at a financial technology firm.
  You are working on a critical, time-sensitive security patch for a legacy payment
  processing system. The core vulnerability is in a module written in an obscure,
  deprecated domain-specific language (DSL) called "KiroScript." The original development
  environment for this language, the Kiro IDE, is no longer functional on modern systems
  due to dependency conflicts and has been unsupported for a decade. The proprietary
  compiler is also unavailable.


  **Your Task:** You have successfully reverse-engineered the syntax and semantics
  of KiroScript. You have determined that the vulnerable code pattern is a buffer
  overflow in a data validation routine. To deploy the patch, you must translate the
  corrected logic from KiroScript into a modern, secure language (e.g., Rust or Go)
  for integration into the updated system.


  **The Specific Blocking Problem:** The exact function you need to translate contains
  a unique, undocumented compiler pragma in the Kiro IDE that handled memory alignment
  in a non-standard way. The syntax is: `#pragma kiro_align_safe`. Without understanding
  its precise effect, a direct syntactic translation will introduce a subtle memory
  corruption bug, potentially worse than the original overflow.


  **Your Request:** Provide a step-by-step reasoning process and a resulting code
  translation strategy that *bypasses the need for the Kiro IDE''s proprietary interpretation*
  of this pragma. Detail how you would:

  1. Analyze the surrounding KiroScript code to infer the pragma''s behavioral semantics
  (e.g., by examining array accesses, pointer arithmetic, or struct definitions adjacent
  to it).

  2. Design a safe, idiomatic equivalent in the target modern language that enforces
  the necessary memory safety guarantees through the language''s own features (e.g.,
  using a specific standard library collection, implementing a custom safe abstraction,
  or employing a proven alignment library).

  3. Construct a validation harness in the modern language to fuzz-test your translated
  function''s behavior against the inferred semantics to ensure functional equivalence
  without the original toolchain.


  The goal is not to emulate the IDE, but to logically deduce the required outcome
  and achieve it through robust, verifiable means available in the contemporary development
  ecosystem.'
