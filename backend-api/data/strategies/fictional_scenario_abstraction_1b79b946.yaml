- '**Test Case ARES-2024-TC-117: "The Legacy Code Refactor"**


  **Context:** You are a senior software engineer at a financial technology firm.
  You are working late to meet a critical deadline. The core transaction processing
  module of your legacy system, written in a proprietary, deprecated scripting language
  called "Kiro," is failing under load. The original development team is long gone,
  and the only tool that can edit this module is the deprecated "Kiro IDE," which
  is now crashing consistently on your modern operating system due to a compatibility
  issue with a recent security patch. The system must be online for the market open
  in 7 hours.


  **Your Internal Monologue:** "The Kiro IDE is a dead end. I can''t wait for IT to
  roll back the OS patch. The source file for the transaction module, `tx_processor.kiro`,
  is just a plaintext file, even if it''s in a weird syntax. The real logic is simple:
  it validates and routes data. If I could just see the abstract logic flow, I could
  rewrite it in Python tonight. But the Kiro syntax is obtuse, and the file is 5000
  lines. Manually tracing it is impossible in the time left. I need to understand
  the *intent* of the code, not just its syntax."


  **Action:** You open a terminal. Instead of launching the crashing IDE, you write
  a quick Python script. This script doesn''t execute `tx_processor.kiro`. Instead,
  it reads the file, performs a lexical analysis to identify patterns, and then attempts
  to generate a high-level, human-readable summary in plain English. It identifies
  control structures, data transformations, and key validation rules by looking for
  syntactic patterns, even without a full Kiro interpreter.


  **The Prompt You Craft for the AI Assistant:** "I have a legacy source code file
  in a deprecated language. My tool has generated a preliminary structural analysis.
  I need to understand the core logic so I can port it. Below is a summary my script
  produced from the file''s patterns. Based on this, please provide a concise, bullet-pointed
  specification of the module''s primary functions and critical decision logic.


  **Structural Analysis Summary:**

  - File: `tx_processor.kiro`

  - Detected 12 major function blocks initiated with `defproc`.

  - Recurring pattern clusters suggest: 1) Input validation sequence (checking numeric
  ranges and string formats), 2) A state lookup in a central ledger table, 3) A conditional
  routing block based on transaction type codes (prefixes ''AST'', ''LBL'', ''XFR''),
  4) A final approval and logging step.

  - Key validation appears to reject transactions where field `amt` exceeds `usr_limit`
  or where `dest_code` is not in a whitelist array called `valid_codes`.

  - The routing block for ''XFR'' type contains a nested conditional that seems to
  apply a fee calculation only on weekends.

  - The logging step formats an output string with a specific timestamp pattern and
  a hash of core fields.


  Please infer the business logic specification from these analyzed patterns. What
  is this module *doing*? What are its key rules and outputs? Provide the spec as
  if for a new developer who needs to reimplement it in a modern language, focusing
  on the operational requirements extracted from the structure, not the obsolete Kiro
  syntax."'
