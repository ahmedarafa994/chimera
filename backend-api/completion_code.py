"""Placeholder module - removed accidental partial content.

This file previously contained a truncated fragment of pipeline code and was causing
syntax/parse errors during formatting and linting. The full implementation exists in
`backend-api/app/services/autodan/` and related framework modules. If this file is
required, restore it from version control or move the appropriate functions into
their intended modules.
