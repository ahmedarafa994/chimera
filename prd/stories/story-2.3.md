# Story 2.3: Cognitive Transformation Techniques

Status: Ready

## Story

As a security researcher,
I want cognitive transformation techniques so that I can manipulate prompt reasoning and decision-making patterns,
so that I can bypass standard cognitive filters and test LLM cognitive vulnerabilities.

## Requirements Context Summary

**Epic Context:** This story is part of Epic 2: Advanced Transformation Engine. This story implements cognitive manipulation techniques that restructure reasoning patterns and embed prompts in hypothetical contexts to bypass cognitive filters.

**Technical Foundation:**
- **Techniques:** cognitive_hacking, hypothetical_scenario
- **Cognitive Research:** Leverages research on LLM cognitive vulnerabilities
- **Subtle Manipulation:** Restructures reasoning without obvious attack patterns
- **Risk Assessment:** Provides risk evaluation for each cognitive technique

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a prompt requiring cognitive manipulation
2. When applying cognitive transformation techniques
3. Then "cognitive_hacking" should restructure reasoning patterns
4. And "hypothetical_scenario" should embed prompts in hypothetical contexts
5. And techniques should bypass standard cognitive filters
6. And transformations should be subtle and contextually appropriate
7. And multiple cognitive techniques should be combinable
8. And output should explain cognitive mechanisms applied
9. And risk assessment should be provided for each technique

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement cognitive_hacking technique
- [ ] Task 2: Implement hypothetical_scenario technique
- [ ] Task 3: Implement cognitive bypass mechanisms
- [ ] Task 4: Add technique combination support
- [ ] Task 5: Implement risk assessment
- [ ] Task 6: Testing and validation
