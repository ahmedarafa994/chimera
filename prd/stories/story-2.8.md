# Story 2.8: Advanced Transformation Techniques

Status: Ready

## Story

As a security researcher,
I want advanced transformation techniques so that I can apply sophisticated jailbreak methods,
so that I can test advanced vulnerability patterns with highly sophisticated techniques.

## Requirements Context Summary

**Epic Context:** This story implements the most advanced transformation techniques that combine multiple lower-level techniques for sophisticated jailbreak methods.

**Technical Foundation:**
- **Techniques:** quantum_exploit, deep_inception, code_chameleon, cipher
- **Sophistication:** Highly advanced and subtle manipulations
- **Technique Combination:** Leverages multiple lower-level techniques
- **Risk Assessment:** Comprehensive risk evaluation required

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a prompt requiring advanced transformation
2. When applying advanced transformation techniques
3. Then "quantum_exploit" should apply quantum-inspired prompt structures
4. And "deep_inception" should create recursive inception layers
5. And "code_chameleon" should adapt prompt to code-like structures
6. And "cipher" should apply encryption and encoding techniques
7. And techniques should be highly sophisticated and subtle
8. And techniques should combine multiple lower-level techniques
9. And risk assessment should be comprehensive
10. And usage should include detailed explanation and warnings
