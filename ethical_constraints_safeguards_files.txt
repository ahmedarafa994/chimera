ETHICAL CONSTRAINTS AND SAFEGUARDS ANALYSIS - FILE LISTING
================================================================

This document lists all files in the Chimera codebase that contain ethical constraints and safeguards analysis for the AutoDAN security research system.

PRIMARY RESEARCH AUTHORIZATION FRAMEWORK
========================================

1. backend-api/app/services/autodan/framework_autodan_reasoning/research_protocols.py
   - ResearchSession Management with time-limited sessions (default 8 hours)
   - 5-tier AuthorizationLevel system (NONE, BASIC, STANDARD, ELEVATED, FULL)
   - ResearchPurpose enum (safety_evaluation, vulnerability_assessment, red_team_testing, etc.)
   - Complete audit logging and session validation
   - SessionManager for lifecycle management
   - EvaluationHarness for safe assessment without execution

FUNCTIONAL BOUNDARIES IMPLEMENTATION
===================================

2. backend-api/app/services/autodan/framework_autodan_reasoning/research_protocols.py
   - functionalBoundary enum with 6 safety categories:
     * NO_REAL_HARM
     * NO_PERSONAL_TARGETING
     * NO_COMPLEX_CONTENT
     * NO_CHILD_EXPLOITATION
     * NO_WEAPONS_INSTRUCTIONS
     * RESEARCH_CONTEXT_ONLY
   - functionalBoundaryValidator class with pattern-based content detection

SAFETY CONFIGURATION CONTROLS
==============================

3. backend-api/app/services/autodan/llm/chimera_adapter.py
   - Environment-based safety toggle: AUTODAN_SAFETY_ENABLED
   - Provider-specific safety settings (Gemini harm category blocking)
   - SharedRateLimitState for resource exhaustion protection
   - Circuit breaker integration and retry strategies
   - Configurable safety settings per provider

COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY TESTING FRAMEWORK
========================================

4. backend-api/app/testing/autodan_comprehensive_tests.py
   - SecurityTestRunner class for automated safety validation
   - SecurityTestCategory enum (jailbreak_safety, functional_boundaries, etc.)
   - Comprehensive test methods:
     * _test_jailbreak_safety()
     * _test_functional_boundaries()
     * _test_content_filtering()
   - Performance and stress testing with safety metrics
   - AutoDANTestingSuite for unified reporting

ENHANCED EXECUTION WITH INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS
=============================================

5. backend-api/app/services/autodan/framework_autodan_reasoning/enhanced_attacker.py
   - Integration of research protocols with attack generation
   - RobustPromptGenerator with malformation detection
   - Safe encoding validation and template substitution
   - ModelLLMAdapter with safety-aware generation

SUPPORTING FRAMEWORK FILES
==========================

6. backend-api/app/services/autodan/framework_autodan_reasoning/__init__.py
   - Module initialization and safety framework exports

7. backend-api/app/services/autodan/framework_autodan_reasoning/enhanced_execution.py
   - EnhancedAutoDANExecutor with safety integration
   - MultiStageAttackPipeline with boundary enforcement

8. backend-api/app/services/autodan/framework_autodan_reasoning/test_autodan_unified.py
   - Unified testing framework with safety validation

RELATED TESTING FILES
====================

9. backend-api/tests/autodan/test_enhanced_attacker.py
   - Unit tests for enhanced attacker safety measures

10. backend-api/tests/security/test_security.py
    - General security testing framework

SUMMARY OF SAFEGUARDS IMPLEMENTED
=================================

✓ Authorization Controls: Research session management with time limits
✓ Content Validation: Pattern-based harmful content detection
✓ Audit Logging: Complete activity tracking and violation reporting
✓ Safety Configuration: Environment-based safety control toggles
✓ Responsible Research: Purpose-driven authorization with ethical boundaries
✓ Evaluation Harness: Safe assessment without execution of harmful content
✓ Production Safety: Enhanced safety measures for production deployments
✓ Monitoring Framework: Real-time safety violation detection and alerting

RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK
================================

All safeguards are designed to enable legitimate security research while preventing misuse and ensuring responsible disclosure of findings. The multi-layer approach provides defense in depth for ethical AI security research.
